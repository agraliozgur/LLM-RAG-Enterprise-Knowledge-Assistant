This is a manual and timeconsuming process. When a new member joins a team, there are typically lots of onboarding formalities to be completed. To get access to different systems, for example, they may be by sending emails or creating support tickets. For teams supporting multiple applications, its challenging to get the required information or understand the logic of applications required for fixing a production issue. They must go through multiple documents or work with the development team to get the details. These scenarios present significant hurdles for support teams, business users, and new members who often encounter difficulties locating the relevant documentation. Introducing a form of automation to address this issue can yield substantial benefits. Such automation could enhance document accessibility and content availability, leading to notable time savings and improved productivity."}

Generative AI on AWS Generative AI can create new content and ideas, such as conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Unlike other AI, it doesnt work with preexisting data; instead, it uses machine learning (ML) models to generate novel and original content based on the principles of probability and statistics. One of the key technologies behind generative AI is called a transformerbased neural network architecture. This involves training large models containing billions of parameters or variables, which are then able to manipulate and transform input data in various ways to produce new and unique output. The result is that generative AI can create content thats similar to how humans think and create, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications."}

FMs in generative AI are largescale neural network architectures that serve as the basis, or foundation, for various generative tasks. These models are pretrained on vast amounts of diverse data, learning to understand and capture the patterns, structures, and representations present in the data. These models can be fine tuned for specific tasks or used as a starting point for generating new content in various domains. Enterprises around the world are exploring the possibilities and potential of generative AI, and realizing the inherent complexity associated with leveraging it to address business challenges. This is why AWS made the commitment to simplify and democratize generative AI. Infosys Solution Overview This solution offers a chatlike interface for users to perform semantic search and ask questions based on various internal documents within an organization. The solution is built using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, which provides easy access to many pretrained, public models (FMs, taskspecific models) to solve a wide range of problems. We will explain the architecture pattern and best practices to implement a knowledge base virtual assistant using AWS."}

This architecture can be divided into two flows: Indexing flow: You are indexing the document contents from different sources into Amazon Kendra with optional transformations (document enrichment). Retrieval flow: As part of this, youre getting the user question, chat history, creating prompt template, getting the document excerpts, getting the final summarized answer from the LLM, and sending it back to the app. Here are the detailed steps involved in this approach: 1. Amazon Kendra is connected to different sources of documents, which are ingested into a Kendra index along with document enrichment wherever required. 2. User asks a question in the chat interface of the application. The frontend is built using the Streamlit application and deployed under AWS Fargate, which provides a serverless container option for application deployment. 3. Chatbot application initiates the chain from a LangChain script. LangChain is a powerful opensource framework useful for developing orchestrations around LLMs."}

These steps are done as part of initiating chain: Create Kendra Retriever. Define LLM object for Amazon SageMaker endpoint. Create prompt template. 36\n12325, 12:39 AM How Infosys Built an Enterprise Knowledge Management Assistant Using Generative AI on AWS AWS Partner Network (APN) Blog Create the chain object. 5. From the Streamlit app, execute the chain. The chain function internally does this: 1. Query Kendra index with user question. 2. Call SageMaker LLM endpoint by passing the user question, response from Kendra, prompt, and user chat history. This returns the final response in a summarized manner. 6. Cache the LLM response. When a user asks a question for the first time, the response from the LLM is cached. Later, when anyone asks the same question in the chatbot, it gets the response from the cache and returns to the chatbot. LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs."}

This would improve the performance of the application. More details can be be found here for LLM caching integrations. 7. The response from SageMaker endpoint is finally returned to the frontend application, to the user. 8. This is the future flow using Amazon Bedrock API. Bedrock makes it easy to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models. Using the API call, you can invoke any LLMs available under Bedrock (this will replace Step 5.2 mentioned above). Design Principles and Components This solution approach is based on six key design principles: Userfriendly interface Costeffective architecture Latest information Performance Scalability Privacy and security As part of this solution, the architecture is split into five components: Source data ingestion Frontend web application Backend orchestration Application deployment Generative AI service Lets go through these components in detail by ensuring the abovementioned design principles."}

By using Amazon Kendra connectors, you can connect to these sources; by enabling data sync, you can ensure the freshness of the data stored in Kendra index. Frontend web application: You can use Streamlit for developing the frontend web application. Streamlit is an opensource Pythonbased application framework that can be used to develop rich user interface (UI) in less time. The application also stores the user chat history, and using this approach you can deploy both Streamlit based frontend application and LangChainbased orchestration in AWS Fargate. Backend orchestration: To orchestrate the backend process, you can use LangChain framework which works as a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) step in this flow. This first retrieves the document excerpts from Kendra index based on the user question, then passes it to the LLM along with the user question, prompt, and chat history to get the final response in a summarized manner."}

You can also enable a caching capability so you could cache the LLM calls, so similar requests can be served from the cache itself. During document ingestion into Kendra index, you can implement a document enrichment process to filter out any sensitive information like personally identifiable information (PII). By doing this, you can restrict any PII data returned as a chatbot response to the end user. Application deployment: For this, you need to create Docker image for Streamlitbased frontend application and LangChainbased scripts, and push them to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository. Then, create tasks in Fargate for running the application. Generative AI service: For this application, you can deploy the LLM from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart. This application uses Llama27bchat model as the LLM model which is optimized for dialogue use cases. Conclusion In this post, we explored how generative AI can help you create an advanced knowledge search assistant to efficiently access your knowledge repository. By strategically utilizing a conversational interface and large language model capabilities, you can develop a sophisticated chat application to handle queries and draw insights to provide tailored, uptodate information."}

GETTY The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in business is continuous. What started as simple chatbots providing basic customer service has now grown into enterprise knowledge assistants (EKAs) that act as strategic allies. 16\n12325, 12:38 AM From Chatbots To Business Allies: Enterprise Knowledge Assistants These modern AIpowered tools are designed to change how we search for information, provide customer support, manage tasks and do business. As we look to the future, it becomes clear that EKAs are becoming the trend in the corporate world. The Journey From Chatbots To Knowledge Assistants MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum developed the first chatbot in the 1960s. It was called ELIZA. The program was designed to mimic human conversation. ELIZA reviewed the words that users entered on a computer and then matched them to a list of possible scripted responses."}

However, Weizenbaum rejected the notion that machines could replace human intellect. Over time, IKEA's Anna Ask characterized the first wave of AI for businesses. It was huge in the 2000s. Anna answers questions about IKEA products, prices, sizes, delivery, spare parts, opening hours, etc., and opens related pages in a browser window. Furthermore, she knows when your local IKEA restaurant is open and what they serve for lunch! Anna also answers simple but personal questions like, What's your name? On top of that, she shows emotions, for example, if she can't find the information you are looking for. However, only in the second half of the 20th century did the world see other versions of AI chatbots, such as Alexa, Siri, Google Now and, finally, ChatGPT. Unlike their predecessors, EKAs leverage advanced AI technologies, including machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). ML and NLP are supplemental for EKAs, which is the main point of creating custom LLMs to provide qualified support across various business functions."}

Even studying beyond that, one is always taking a French class with other Anglophones (or 'allophones'...other language speakers). Using this app as an adjunct to those classes will not threaten French instruction or the jobs of French teachers. On the contrary, it will make those classes much more effective. Group access price ....utsyrak, get to it. Then, email the provincial Ministries of Education and tell them about it; this could easily be integrated into our compulsory French instruction classes. The case is similar in Quebec for English instruction. (Education is provincial jurisdiction in Canada). Also, later when you're making more money from this, think about endangered languages (Aboriginal, regional, Welsh, Irish etc). There are many that are on the brink of extinction.

Yet, the solutions remain costly, timeconsuming, and challenging to use. Why enterprise search solutions dont solve the problem Consider your own hard drive, likely filled with a variety of notes, documents, screenshots, scans, and more. Identifying the content of each file often requires opening them individually. Similarly, enterprise data on a larger scale is just as, if not more, disorganized. It's stored across various formats and applications, including Slack messages, support message queues, call transcripts, and more. Up to 80 of enterprise data is unstructured, scattered across different locations and formats. For this data to be included in enterprise search, it must first be located, read by a human or machine, categorized, tagged with keywords, or otherwise processed. This makes setup and maintenance a significant undertaking."}

Its why we created Dash AI an AI knowledge assistant that can answer questions, find files, write code, create content and more all based on a companys internal knowledge. AI offers significant improvements over traditional keyword searches, including understanding the context and parsing the meaning of questions. This ability allows AI assistants to understand data more deeply, categorizing content with greater accuracy than keywordbased crawlers. For example, if an employee asks about the revenue from the latest marketing campaign, the assistant can gather data from both Salesforce and Google Drive to provide a comprehensive response.

Many enterprises worry about potential data leaks from employee use of ChatGPT. Typically, the simplest way to provide data to an LLM company is to index and store it, but this approach can lead to security vulnerabilities and longer rollout times. An alternative hosting the enterprise AI solution on the company's own cloud can increase costs. Dash AI takes a different approach. Instead of indexing data, it connects to applications via APIs, performs realtime searches, ranks the received data, and passes it through an LLM for a naturallanguage response. This method, which combines advanced API technology with sophisticated LLMs, significantly reduces the risk of a security breach as all data is stored in firstparty apps. It also boosts company productivity by providing realtime natural language access to all company data at an affordable price. What's next?"}

Lets get started. 228\n12225, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management 2024 Atomicwork What is enterprise knowledge management? Enterprise Knowledge Management, or enterprise information management (EIM), is the systematic process of capturing, organizing, and leveraging an organization's data using advanced technology to enhance its strategic capabilities. It goes beyond simple information cataloging, focusing on the intelligent curation and deployment of knowledge assets to drive innovation, streamline decision making, and facilitate cross functional collaboration. A knowledge management system helps you find information and answers to your questions issues. It eliminates the need for a dedicated team to help find answers to already existing solutions. For example, you can quickly find answers to questions about company policies, like the leave policy or accessing the company VPN."}

How do I access my work files from my home? How has enterprise information management evolved? EIM has evolved significantly over the years, becoming more agile and userfriendly.

The result was human agents overflowing with support requests they could barely handle. 428\n12225, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management 2024 Atomicwork Alternatively, selfhelp portals were difficult to use and remained underutilized in most enterprises. They also lacked proper integration with daily operations and workflows and provided generic responses, limiting the effectiveness of early EIM systems.

Here's What We Learned Navigating a multitude of knowledge bases (including our own) led us to create an AIpowered assistant Lets start with a bit of honesty: enterprise knowledge bases are a mess more frequently than organizations want to admit. How do we know? Well, lets just say, weve seen our share of haphazardly scattered pages and documents in which finding an answer would be a quest on its own. And finding an answer immediately would be nearly impossible. 111\n12325, 12:36 AM AI for Enterprise Knowledge Management: Intellias Experience First, we tried relying on various tools, all serving different purposes across different teams.

We also wanted our new enterprise AI knowledge management system to act like a 247 advisor for employees essentially, a bot guiding them through any type of request, from booking vacations to making career or rotation choices. So, how could AI help? While exploring the vast opportunities of AI, we found its primary strengths: locating relevant information, structuring it, and generating responses based on requests. Sounds like a game changer? It really is. Did you know that according to a study by the International Data Corporation (IDC), employees spend over five hours a week waiting for information? This leads to delayed projects and annual productivity losses of up to 31.5 billion just by failing to share knowledge among employees!

But AI has changed all of this. Embedding artificial intelligence in enterprise knowledge management platforms gives you powerful search capabilities, automated knowledge retrieval, and instant organization of all entries. This alone reduces the frustration of endless searches for information and ensures that employees can focus on their work instead. It boils down to time, money, and opportunities you now wont miss.

A knowledge base is also an integral component of enterprise knowledge management: a system for leveraging and organizing information within the company through creating, retaining, transferring, and applying knowledge. Knowledge creation happens through research, experimentation, and collaboration. Basically, it is the process of generating new ideas, identifying opportunities, exploring new concepts, and developing innovative solutions. Knowledge retention is about preserving existing knowledge, ensuring longterm access to critical assets like documents, data, and expertise. This involves systems for documentation, training, and structured processes to effectively capture and store information. Knowledge transfer requires an effective system for sharing expertise between employees and teams through methods such as mentoring, coaching, and structured sessions like communities of practice. Knowledge application is translating knowledge into action to solve problems and make strategic decisions. This involves training, using decisionmaking frameworks, and sharing best practices across the organization. But a knowledge management system is not enough; you still need a centralized place to consolidate all company knowledge that is accessible to all employees at any time."}

Structure and ContentAware Chunking: Considers sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters when chunking. Preserve logical boundaries, which can significantly improve retrieval quality. DocumentBased Chunking: With this chunking method, you split a document based on its inherent structure. This approach respects the natural flow of the content but may not be as effective for documents that lack a clear structure. Hierarchical Chunking: Combines fixedsize and structureawareness by chunking at multiple levels (document chapter paragraph) and linking them in a parentchild relationship. Semantic Chunking: The main idea is to group text segments with similar meaning. You create embeddings for each segment, then compare those embeddings to see which ones are most closely related. This approach keeps similar ideas together, preventing arbitrary splits that could harm retrieval quality. Agentic Chunking: This method empowers an LLM to dynamically decide how to split the text into chunks. We begin by extracting short, independent statements from the text and let an LLM agent determine if each statement should join an existing chunk or start a new one."}

Introduction\nThe discussion about the myriad applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) is extensive and welltrodden in tech circles1. These models have opened many use cases, reshaping sectors from customer service to content creation. However, an oftenoverlooked aspect in this discourse is the practicality of productizing and scaling these use cases to support tens of thousands of users2. The challenges range from expanding server capacity, tweaking algorithms, ensuring robustness and reliability, and maintaining privacy and security. In this article, we describe some of the considerations necessary when developing an enterpriselevel knowledge assistant (KA) and introduce a scalable architecture. Foundational Architecture Principles\nA welldesigned KA must offer roundtheclock operation in a demanding enterprise environment and embody more than just cuttingedge AI capabilities. It should be finetuned for quality and speed and structured for continuous improvement, allowing for seamless integration and evolution of new functionalities."}

To achieve these high standards of operational excellence, the KA is built upon five foundational architecture principles. Each principle plays a critical role in ensuring that the KA meets the immediate needs of a large user base and remains a versatile and forwardlooking solution, ready to adapt and grow with the changing landscape of enterprise requirements. Scalability: Addressing the high volume of interactions and the expansion needs of AI applications. Security: Ensuring data safety and strict access control in a world where information security is paramount. Transparency: Offering clear insights into system operations, usage metrics, and cost implications. Modularity: Facilitating easy upgrades and modifications to stay abreast of technological advancements. Reusability: Promoting efficiency and collaboration by designing components that can be used across various projects. These foundational architecture principles are intricately woven into every aspect of the suggested design, forming the backbone of a retrievalaugmented generation (RAG) architecture. EarlyStage Decisions Enhancing KAs Foundational Principles\nQuality Over Cost: We know quality matters. This foundational choice means accepting more significant upfront expenses linked to token usage and infrastructure."}

ServiceBased LLMs: Another critical early decision adopts a servicebased approach to LLMs. This choice underscores the need for flexibility and scalability in a KAs languageprocessing capabilities. By integrating stateoftheart servicebased LLMs, any KA is equipped to rapidly adapt to changing conditions and technological advances, positioning it as a cuttingedge solution in this technology realm. LLMAgnosticism: As the space of generative AI develops, and new players and models enter the space regularly, it is essential that a KA is futureproofed by offering the option to switch the underlying LLM(s) easily. These earlystage decisions shape the design of a KA into a robust, adaptable, and highperforming enterprise KA. As we explore the multilayered architecture of such a KA in the following sections, well see how these enhanced principles drive the design and functionality of each layer in the system. A RAG architecture\nAt the core of the KA is a carefully crafted architecture segmented into four essential layers, each with its unique function and set of challenges. This multilayered approach forms the KAs structural and operational framework, grounded by the foundational principles described above."}

It is crucial for the KAs enterprisespecific intelligence. LLM Layer: The generalpurpose intelligence and processing center for all language model requests, ensuring contextually accurate and relevant responses. Reporting Layer: The analytical segment, which provides usage, cost, and performance metrics insights. Application Layer: The userfacing interface and backend with business logic a key layer of the KA that navigates logic for forming responses to endusers. As we embark on a detailed journey through the layers, we will briefly examine the Data, LLM, and Reporting layers, highlighting their roles and significance. The spotlight will then shift to an indepth look at the Application Layer, where the KAs functionalities come to life, directly interacting with, and serving, the endusers. 1. Data Layer\nThe Data Layer of the KA is integral to its enterprisespecific intelligence, anchored by a vector store that stores documents in chunks, along with their embeddings and metadata4. This vector store is essential for facilitating search using semantic similarity on a large scale, ensuring performance remains robust even as data volumes expand."}
{"unique_id": "ce0c7908-cf18-44b2-81f7-ed032cb7a6ee", "file_name": "How to Build a Knowledge Assistant at Scale.docx", "extensionpe": ".docx", "chunk_id": 4, "text": "LLMs have limits on how much data they can accept and process at one time (also known as token limits), making it hard to process long documents simultaneously. We recommend use of a wellknown chunking technique to break documents into smaller parts to solve this. This enables search across the whole document in steps, avoiding an LLMs token limit. Metadata stored alongside chunks enables us to associate information found during searches with source documents. Custom pipelines enrich the data with as much relevant metadata as possible to improve search results. This capability maintains context and relevance in the KAs responses. Selecting the suitable vector database and the appropriate chunking strategy is critical. Different chunking strategies, such as syntactic versus semantic, variable versus fixed, play distinct roles in how data is processed and retrieved5. To handle the vast amounts of data, we recommend a Data Lake with data processing pipelines, implemented with a framework like the opensource Pythonbased Kedro6. These pipelines should be tasked with parsing, chunking, metadata enrichment, and vectorizing data chunks, subsequently populating the vector databases. These pipelines need wellstructured and indexed data storage, so it is crucial to have healthy data quality and governance in place."}

These APIs may offer additional context and relevant information, enhancing the capability to deliver tailored and intelligent responses. Finally, its important to control who can access what. If a user cant see a document, the KA should not take it into response formation. The data access control component should be decoupled from the KA itself. This approach not only fortifies security and ensures compliance but also elegantly paves the way for seamless scalability across multiple KAs. 2. LLM Layer\nThe LLM Layer in the KAs architecture serves as the central unit of processing. This layer is uniquely designed to handle the complexities and demands of processing language model requests, playing a critical role in the functionality of the KA. A key component of the LLM Layer is the LLM API Gateway. This gateway is the conduit through which all requests pass, acting as a centralized processing point. Its design includes scalableondemand integrations with multiple LLM vendors, offering the flexibility to easily switch services as needed."}

An important function of the LLM API Gateway is its ability to track the costs associated with using LLMs (e.g. tokens generated, subscriptions). This feature is vital for managing the operational budget and optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, the gateway logs all interactions in a logging platform. This logging is not just about keeping a record; its a treasure trove of data that can be analyzed for improvements, troubleshooting, and understanding usage patterns. Within this layer, there is direct access to both LLM models and Embedding models. The LLM models are the backbone of the KAs language understanding and generation capabilities. Meanwhile, the Embeddings models, which are also used by the Data Layer for vectorizing document chunks, play a critical role in enhancing the semantic search capabilities of the KA. 3. Reporting Layer\nThe Reporting Layer in any KAs architecture is essential for providing transparency on several critical fronts: costs, usage, and data analytics. This layer is intricately designed to capture and present a comprehensive view of the KAs operational dynamics, making it an invaluable tool for both management and continuous improvement."}

This includes costs associated with token consumption by LLMs, data processing, and other computational resources. By offering detailed insights into these expenditures, the Reporting Layer enables effective budget management and helps identify opportunities for cost optimization. Another crucial aspect of this layer is usage monitoring. It keeps a close watch on how the KA is being used across the organization. This monitoring covers various metrics, such as the number of user interactions, peak usage times, and the types of queries being processed. Understanding these usage patterns is vital for scaling the KA effectively and ensuring it meets the evolving needs of the enterprise. Additionally, the Reporting Layer delves into data analytics, providing an indepth look at the performance and effectiveness of the KA. This includes analyzing response accuracy, user satisfaction, and the overall efficiency of the KAs operations. Such analytics are instrumental in guiding future improvements, ensuring the KA remains a cuttingedge tool for the enterprise. 4."}

This layer is where user queries are generated, received, processed, and responded to, encompassing the endtoend interaction that defines the user experience. The Application Layer comprises of four main components:\nFrontend: This is the user interface of the KA, where users interact and input their queries. Operational Stores: These are databases that store the KAs conversational history and user feedback. Configuration Stores: This component contains glossaries for query improvement and prompts from response generation. Backend: The backend processes API requests from frontend, handling the intricate task of understanding and generating responses integrating to services from LLMs and Data Layers\nFrontend\nThe frontend of the KA should be a straightforward web interface, typically crafted using React and JavaScript. Design should consider ease of use, for users to simply ask questions, receive answers, and access guidelines for effective interaction with the KA. This interface design may consider inclusion of a feature for users to provide feedback, essential for refining the KAs performance. Responses to user queries should be supported by clearly cited sources to offer a reliable reference for the shared information."}

This approach adds a layer of practical utility to each response, directing users to additional resources or personnel that can provide more indepth support or information. The modular design of the KA architecture plays a key role here. It allows for the possibility of substituting a frontend with alternative interfaces in the future, such as a mobile app or an instant messaging platform. This flexibility comes about because the backend interactions occur through APIs, enabling seamless integration with various frontends while maintaining consistent functionality and user experience. Operational Stores\nOperational stores form the backend persistence layer, responsible for the storage of conversation history, user settings, feedback, and other critical operational data essential for the KA to be functional. Conversation history is particularly important for providing historic context to the LLM, enhancing the relevance of responses in ongoing interactions. Additionally, the information gathered in operational stores is crucial for the continuous improvement of the KA. This data is analyzed within the Data Layer to identify trends and areas for enhancement, directly influencing the KAs development and refinement."}

Its structured as a set of components, each with a single responsibility, working together to process user interactions efficiently. At a highlevel, it is an orchestration of different decisions and LLM operations. It handles critical functions such as accessing the Data Layer and LLMs, analyzing incoming requests, formulating messages, and delivering responses. Each component is designed to perform its specific task effectively, ensuring that the entire process from query intake to response delivery is smooth and precise. The following section traces a user query through the complete backend architecture.

The primary objective of these guardrails is to prevent users from using the system in ways that deviate from its intended purpose. For instance, in the scenario of a flight booking app, customers should not have the capability to inquire about other passengers beyond the scope of their valid booking. Guardrails are essentially a stack of functions arranged in a predetermined order. Each function evaluates the incoming request input and its metadata and takes one of three possible actions. The possible actions include pass indicating that the guardrail approves the request without any issues; update this suggests the request requires modification before being allowed to pass; and reject signaling that the request failed the guardrail and cannot continue for processing, this terminates the process and returns a rejection reason to the requester."}

One such updateguardrail is the Query Improver. This component is crucial for adapting domainspecific terminology to enhance later retrieval processes. In many industries and business, queries include niche jargon, abbreviations, and phrases unique to the industry. These can be obscure or have different meanings in general language. To address this, the implementation should include a comprehensive glossary of companyspecific terms and abbreviations. This glossary translates and modifies user queries for optimal retrieval. For instance, it could remove trailing punctuation and expand acronyms in the queries (e.g. MVP is reformulated as MVP (Minimum Viable Product)). Such alterations significantly boost the retrieval effectiveness on proprietary data. Eliminating punctuation aids in aligning the querys semantic similarity with a corpus, which predominantly consists of statements rather than questions."}

Such refinements are instrumental in enhancing the overall performance and accuracy of a KA. The next step in the process is the Intent Recognition module, a common feature in LLM applications designed to bring structure to the typically unstructured nature of LLMs. This modules function is to categorize each user query into one of several predefined intents. The identified intent plays a dual role: it guides the subsequent control flow within the application and enhances the effectiveness of the knowledge retrieval system. The most reliable method for intent recognition isnt a highly specialized machine learning model but rather an LLM. To improve the LLMs accuracy, we suggest a fewshot prompting technique with balanced examples for each intent. For instance, if we have five intents and three examples per intent to ensure accurate classification, then every intent is represented with three examples. This gives us a total of 15 examples in the prompt."}

However, its important to note that this approach has its limitations. As the number of intents increases, adding more examples becomes less practical, and distinguishing between intents becomes more challenging. Response Formation\nData Source Routing\nThe Data Source Routing module determines where the KA receives its knowledge based on the users intent. With the users intent, the KA picks between three primary data sources, each accessible through a custom search algorithm or external APIs:\nVector Store: Text documents, like PDFs, PowerPoints, and Word documents. All chunks have metadata that enables filtering like title, abstract, authors etc. People Directory API: Personnel information, specific skills, and contact details. Internal Wiki API: Companyrelated information, IT instructions, HR documents and more. The real advantage of intent recognition lies in its flexibility to incorporate additional data sources as needed. Beyond enhancing the control over the KAs outputs, selective querying of data sources offers another significant benefit. While many solutions emphasize vector stores and semantic similarity search, not all data types are equally suited for such methods."}

In a standard similarity search, even welldetailed people profiles might not rank high enough to be included in the top results. Intent recognition circumvents this issue through clearly defined control flow. This behavior can be implemented using different chains for different intents, as in the example below. INTENTCHAINMAPPING\nIntentType.KNOWLEDGE: KnowledgeChain,\nIntentType.PEOPLE: PeopleChain,\nIntentType.SUPPORT: WikiChain,\nIntentType.CHAT: ChatChain,\nIntentType.DOMAINKNOWLEDGE: DomainKnowledgeChain,\ndef getresponse(question: str, conversationhistory: ListMessage):\nchain intentchainmappingintent\nllm AIGateway(modelgpt4)\nllmtask asyncio.createtask(chain.acall(question, llm, conversationhistory))\n...\nresponse await llmtask\nreturn response\nclass KnowledgeChain(Chain):\n...\nclass DomainKnowledgeChain(Chain):\n...\nclass ChatChain(Chain):\n...\nclass PeopleChain(Chain):\n...\nRetriever\nThe question is then passed to the Retriever. Depending on the targeted search the retriever will either embed the question through LLM Gateway and perform a semantic similarity search, use it for a keyword search, or pass it to an external API that handles the retrieval. The Retriever should be tailored to manage different types of data effectively. Each data source not only varies in content but also in the optimal amount of information to retrieve."}

To address this, the retrieval logic needs customization. For peoplerelated queries, the retriever is configured to return a concise list of the top five most relevant contacts from the directory. In contrast, a search for knowledge yields a broader set, pulling up to 20 chunks of information to provide a more comprehensive context. This approach, however, is not rigid. For specific intents where a more integrated perspective is beneficial, a Retriever should combine data from multiple sources. For instance, a user seeking guidance in a specific domain will receive information both from the vector store and the wiki as a mix is likely to be most useful to the user. Finetuning the process means definition of a search algorithm that can combine different semantic similarity search algorithms, exact keyword matching and metadata filtering. Additionally, it may require manual tuning in how many items to retrieve from each source for each intent."}

Context Enrichment\nA KAs context enrichment phase requires crafting effective prompts. These prompts must harmoniously blend instructions from the assistant, retrieved context, and the chat history. This process is heavily influenced by the detected intent and come with varying levels of difficulty in consolidating data from different sources. A significant challenge may typically arise in ensuring the relevance and conceptual cohesion for queries seeking pure knowledge. To mitigate reliance on semantic search and enhance accuracy of the final chat completion, there should be consideration given to the strategy inspired by the MapReduceChain in LangChain7 (see KnowledgeChain example below). This method involves deploying parallel LLM calls for each information chunk, instructing the model to not just evaluate but also synthesize information across these chunks. This approach is pivotal in ensuring that source citations are accurate. Instead of depending on the LLM to reproduce source links a method prone to inaccuracies you should embed source referencing directly into code logic."}

As a reminder, the LLM prompt needs to include data from the databases (see Data Source Routing and Retriever) and conversation history. Additionally, its necessary to give clear instructions to the LLM and format the input data correctly, to determine its behavior, tone, and adherence to the given data. Precise prompt engineering becomes a real challenge, as the outputs need to be accurate and reliable for critical decisionmaking."}

To ensure the quality and relevance of responses, there should be a set of early users to test the experience, and subject matter experts from various fields to test the correctness of the KAs responses. Their insights will be invaluable in refining the KAs instructions and guiding the selection of source documents. Output Handler\nOutput Guardrails\nAfter receiving the final chat completion from the LLM, the next step post processes it in the Output Handler. It is typical to find that no matter how carefully you engineer a prompt and steps in advance of the model, there always remains a final risk of hallucinations, and undesirable information being shown to users8. To mitigate this risk, there should be a set of Output Guardrails in place. These are a set of asynchronously executed checks on the models response that include a content filter and a hallucination detector. The content filter detects and removes biased and harmful language as well as removing any personal identifiable information (PII). The hallucination detector checks whether there is any information in the response that is not given in the retrieved context."}

Response Handler\nAfterward, if the chat completion passes the output guardrails, the final step formats the response, and sends it to the front end for the user to read. Summary of Considerations\nWe summarize some of the considerations covered earlier in this article. Chunking: The selection of a chunking strategy significantly impacts the performance of semantic similarity search, the use of context, and the understanding of specific knowledge topics by the language model. Guardrails: Implementing guardrails for inputoutput is crucial to mitigate risks and ensure the reputation of AI applications in enterprise settings. These guardrails can be customized and developed according to the organizations risk requirements. Configuration Database: Maintaining a database table to track LLM configurations allows for efficient monitoring, potential rollback capabilities, and the association of specific model versions with user feedback and errors. Search: Finetuning the search algorithm involves combining semantic similarity search algorithms, exact keyword matching, and metadata filtering, while continuously optimizing retrieval strategies based on user feedback to achieve the right balance of quantity, quality, and source diversity."}

Controlling LLMs: Introducing intent recognition or a similar deterministic split enhances control flow and provides developers with more control over the behavior of LLM applications. Making Data LLMready: Cleaning unstructured data from artifacts (e.g., footers in the middle of chunks) and adding relevant metadata (e.g., titles) to chunks allows LLMs to effectively understand different data types. Separating Data Sources: While it may be tempting to mix all types of data in a vector store and use semantic similarity search, different data types have different requirements, and querying them separately yields much better results. Domain Knowledge: Incorporating specific knowledge through glossaries, prompt engineering, or finetuning is essential for LLMs to understand industry or companyspecific knowledge. Conclusion\nIn the realm of corporate technology, the integration and application of LLMs offer intriguing insights into the evolving landscape of data management, system architecture, and organizational transformation. This article aims to shed light on these aspects, with an emphasis on the broader application of LLMs within corporate settings."}

Extracting from PDFs Before you can feed your data into an RAG pipeline, you need to extract it from PDFs."}

The goal of your chatbotwhether it needs to present actual images, provide textonly responses, or generate image descriptionsdirectly impacts how you extract and process each PDF. For instance, if your chatbot must display or summarize images, youll need dedicated mechanisms to handle, store, and retrieve them; if youre only interested in text, you can focus on raw text extraction and OCR. Text Extraction Use libraries or services that identify text within PDFs. For straightforward text, standard PDF parsing libraries work. However, be mindful of formatting, especially in scanned PDFs with no digital text layer. Also consider headers and footers, which often contain valuable information like document titles, chapter names, page numbers, or dates. You may opt to remove them from the main body of text and store them separately as part of the documents metadata. Image Detection Some PDFs include images or diagrams that may hold critical information. Identifying these images is essential if you need a fully comprehensive pipeline that can reference not just text but also visual elements."}

This ensures you can index, extract, and analyze the content just like any other textbased PDF. The process can be resourceintensive (often requiring GPUs), but its indispensable for processing large volumes of scanned documents. Table Extraction When PDFs contain data in tabular format, consider using specialized tools or libraries (e.g., Tabula, Camelot) to extract tables accurately. Tables often include important figures or text organized in rows and columns, which may otherwise be lost if parsed as standard text. Decide whether to keep the table structure (e.g., converting to CSV or HTML) or to summarize the data for downstream tasks like embedding or semantic search. Metadata Collection Dont forget about titles, authors, creation dates, and other metadata. These details help with advanced filtering and can also influence the retrieval steps later. In some cases, you might add header and footer data here if it provides contextual clues or helps distinguish versions of a document. 2. Chunking Extracted Data Unlike plain search indexes, RAG pipelines often split documents into chunksmanageable text segments used to create embeddings."}

FixedSize Chunking (with overlap): Straightforward approach where each chunk is a fixed number of tokens or characters, and adjacent chunks overlap slightly to retain context. Structure and ContentAware Chunking: Considers sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters when chunking. Preserve logical boundaries, which can significantly improve retrieval quality. DocumentBased Chunking: With this chunking method, you split a document based on its inherent structure. This approach respects the natural flow of the content but may not be as effective for documents that lack a clear structure. Hierarchical Chunking: Combines fixedsize and structureawareness by chunking at multiple levels (document chapter paragraph) and linking them in a parentchild relationship. Semantic Chunking: The main idea is to group text segments with similar meaning. You create embeddings for each segment, then compare those embeddings to see which ones are most closely related. This approach keeps similar ideas together, preventing arbitrary splits that could harm retrieval quality. Agentic Chunking: This method empowers an LLM to dynamically decide how to split the text into chunks."}

Because the model understands context, it can produce more coherent chunks than fixed or structural methods. 3. Generating Embeddings Once you have your chunks, each chunk needs a vector representation (an embedding) that captures its semantic meaning. Choosing Embedding Models Security Considerations: The classification of your documents might prohibit the use of online LLMs, pushing you toward an onpremise or selfhosted model. If confidentiality is a priority, local deployment can ensure that no data leaves your environment. Data Types (Text, Tables, Images, Multimodal): Text: A textbased embedding model may be sufficient if you only have textual data. Tables: For tabular data, you may need to transform the table into a more descriptive text format or use a specialized approach to preserve rowcolumn relationships. One strategy is to summarize tables first and then generate embeddings from those summaries."}

Multimodal models (e.g., CLIP or GPT4 Vision) can handle both text and images, enabling semantic search across different data types. Task Orientation: Think about the end goaltexttotext, imagetotext, imagetoimage, or tablebased queries. Different scenarios benefit from specialized embedding models. Performance Considerations Hardware Requirements: Embedding models often require GPUs or other accelerators for efficient batch processing. Local vs. Cloud Deployment: Weigh the cost and convenience of a cloud solution against the benefits of total control and data sovereignty offered by an onpremises model. Image Table Processing: Generating embeddings for images or large tables typically requires more compute resources and sometimes specialized libraries or frameworks. 4. Storing the Data The diversity of data and the sophistication of AI models demand a flexible, powerful, and nuanced approach to data management. As AI continues to penetrate various sectors, the need for databases that can adapt to complex data landscapes becomes paramount."}
