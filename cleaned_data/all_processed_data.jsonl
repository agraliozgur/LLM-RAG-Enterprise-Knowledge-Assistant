In large organizations, information like project details, application designs, business requirements, support process, and onboarding information are stored as documents in different formats, ranging from Confluence pages and SharePoint documents to Jira tickets and files like Word or PDFs stored in shared drives. Infosys Here are some instances where team members find it challenging to access the right information in an effective manner: When members from a team try to find information about an application developed by other teams, they have to find the subject matter expert (SME) of that application or search for relevant documents.

This is a manual and time-consuming process. When a new member joins a team, there are typically lots of onboarding formalities to be completed. To get access to different systems, for example, they may be by sending emails or creating support tickets. For teams supporting multiple applications, it’s challenging to get the required information or understand the logic of applications required for fixing a production issue. They must go through multiple documents or work with the development team to get the details. These scenarios present significant hurdles for support teams, business users, and new members who often encounter difficulties locating the relevant documentation. Introducing a form of automation to address this issue can yield substantial benefits. Such automation could enhance document accessibility and content availability, leading to notable time savings and improved productivity.

Generative AI on AWS Generative AI can create new content and ideas, such as conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. Unlike other AI, it doesn’t work with pre-existing data; instead, it uses machine learning (ML) models to generate novel and original content based on the principles of probability and statistics. One of the key technologies behind generative AI is called a transformer-based neural network architecture. This involves training large models containing billions of parameters or variables, which are then able to manipulate and transform input data in various ways to produce new and unique output. The result is that generative AI can create content that’s similar to how humans think and create, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications. Generative AI relies on the intelligence of the foundation models (FM) that are also referred as large language models (LLMs). FMs in generative AI are large-scale neural network architectures that serve as the basis, or foundation, for various generative tasks. These models are pre-trained on vast amounts of diverse data, learning to understand and capture the patterns, structures, and representations present in the data. These models can be fine- tuned for specific tasks or used as a starting point for generating new content in various domains.

This is why AWS made the commitment to simplify and democratize generative AI. Infosys Solution Overview This solution offers a chat-like interface for users to perform semantic search and ask questions based on various internal documents within an organization. The solution is built using Amazon SageMaker JumpStart, which provides easy access to many pre-trained, public models (FMs, task-specific models) to solve a wide range of problems. We will explain the architecture pattern and best practices to implement a knowledge base virtual assistant using AWS. Architecture The following diagram depicts the architecture of the complete application. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/how-infosys-built-an-enterprise-knowledge-management-assistant-using-generative-ai-on-aws/ 2/6 1/23/25, 12:39 AM How Infosys Built an Enterprise Knowledge Management Assistant Using Generative AI on AWS | AWS Partner Network (APN) Blog Figure 1 – Architecture for enterprise knowledge management assistant. This architecture can be divided into two flows: Indexing flow: You are indexing the document contents from different sources into Amazon Kendra with optional transformations (document enrichment). Retrieval flow: As part of this, you’re getting the user question, chat history, creating prompt template, getting the document excerpts, getting the final summarized answer from the LLM, and sending it back to the app."}

Retrieval flow: As part of this, you’re getting the user question, chat history, creating prompt template, getting the document excerpts, getting the final summarized answer from the LLM, and sending it back to the app. Here are the detailed steps involved in this approach: 1. Amazon Kendra is connected to different sources of documents, which are ingested into a Kendra index along with document enrichment wherever required. 2. User asks a question in the chat interface of the application. The frontend is built using the Streamlit application and deployed under AWS Fargate, which provides a serverless container option for application deployment. 3. Chatbot application initiates the chain from a LangChain script. LangChain is a powerful open-source framework useful for developing orchestrations around LLMs. It offers many useful capabilities that are helpful for creating complex generative AI pipelines around one or more LLMs. 4. These steps are done as part of initiating chain: Create Kendra Retriever. Define LLM object for Amazon SageMaker endpoint. Create prompt template. https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/how-infosys-built-an-enterprise-knowledge-management-assistant-using-generative-ai-on-aws/ 3/6 1/23/25, 12:39 AM How Infosys Built an Enterprise Knowledge Management Assistant Using Generative AI on AWS | AWS Partner Network (APN) Blog Create the chain object. 5.

Call SageMaker LLM endpoint by passing the user question, response from Kendra, prompt, and user chat history. This returns the final response in a summarized manner. 6. Cache the LLM response. When a user asks a question for the first time, the response from the LLM is cached. Later, when anyone asks the same question in the chatbot, it gets the response from the cache and returns to the chatbot. LangChain provides an optional caching layer for LLMs. This is useful for two reasons: It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. This would improve the performance of the application. More details can be be found here for LLM caching integrations. 7. The response from SageMaker endpoint is finally returned to the frontend application, to the user. 8. This is the future flow using Amazon Bedrock API. Bedrock makes it easy to build and scale generative AI applications with foundation models. Using the API call, you can invoke any LLMs available under Bedrock (this will replace Step 5.2 mentioned above).

By using Amazon Kendra connectors, you can connect to these sources; by enabling data sync, you can ensure the freshness of the data stored in Kendra index. Frontend web application: You can use Streamlit for developing the frontend web application. Streamlit is an open-source Python-based application framework that can be used to develop rich user interface (UI) in less time. The application also stores the user chat history, and using this approach you can deploy both Streamlit- based frontend application and LangChain-based orchestration in AWS Fargate.

It then returns this response to the chatbot application. . You can also enable a caching capability so you could cache the LLM calls, so similar requests can be served from the cache itself. During document ingestion into Kendra index, you can implement a document enrichment process to filter out any sensitive information like personally identifiable information (PII). By doing this, you can restrict any PII data returned as a chatbot response to the end user. Application deployment: For this, you need to create Docker image for Streamlit-based frontend application and LangChain-based scripts, and push them to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository. Then, create tasks in Fargate for running the application. Generative AI service: For this application, you can deploy the LLM from Amazon SageMaker JumpStart.

GETTY The evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in business is continuous. What started as simple chatbots providing basic customer service has now grown into enterprise knowledge assistants (EKAs) that act as strategic allies. https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/06/13/from-chatbots-to-business-allies-enterprise-knowledge-assistantsc/ 1/6 1/23/25, 12:38 AM From Chatbots To Business Allies: Enterprise Knowledge Assistants These modern AI-powered tools are designed to change how we search for information, provide customer support, manage tasks and do business. As we look to the future, it becomes clear that EKAs are becoming the trend in the corporate world. The Journey From Chatbots To Knowledge Assistants MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum developed the first chatbot in the 1960s. It was called ELIZA. The program was designed to mimic human conversation. ELIZA reviewed the words that users entered on a computer and then matched them to a list of possible scripted responses. Experts declared that chatbots would be indistinguishable from humans within a few years. However, Weizenbaum rejected the notion that machines could replace human intellect.

Over time, IKEA's Anna Ask characterized the first wave of AI for businesses. It was huge in the 2000s. Anna answers questions about IKEA products, prices, sizes, delivery, spare parts, opening hours, etc., and opens related pages in a browser window. Furthermore, she knows when your local IKEA restaurant is open and what they serve for lunch! Anna also answers simple but personal questions like, \"What's your name?\" On top of that, she shows emotions, for example, if she can't find the information you are looking for. However, only in the second half of the 20th century did the world see other versions of AI chatbots, such as Alexa, Siri, Google Now and, finally, ChatGPT. Unlike their predecessors, EKAs leverage advanced AI technologies, including machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP). ML and NLP are supplemental for EKAs, which is the main point of creating custom LLMs to provide qualified support across various business functions. https://www.forbes.com/councils/forbestechcouncil/2024/06/13/from-chatbots-to-business-allies-enterprise-knowledge-assistantsc/ 2/6 1/23/25, 12:38 AM From Chatbots To Business Allies: Enterprise Knowledge Assistants They do more than answer questions—they understand context, learn from interactions and adapt to the enterprise's specific needs.

Whether it’s business reports, regulatory documents, user manuals, or research papers, the ability to extract and utilize insights from these documents is becoming essential. The current platforms, like SharePoint, for example—do a pretty good job when it comes to text searches, but searching for images, or even within images, let alone performing truly semantic searches, is not possible. RAG, short for Retrieval Augmented Generation, is a framework designed for large language models (LLMs) to enhance their ability to access relevant, up-to-date, and context-specific information by seamlessly combining retrieval and generation capabilities. https://cratedb.com/blog/building-ai-knowledge-assistants-for-enterprise-pdfs 1/7 1/22/25, 10:22 PM CrateDB Blog | Building AI Knowledge Assistants for Enterprise PDFs: A Strategic Approach Live Stream on Jan 23rd: Unlocking Real Time Insights in the Renewable Energy Sector with CrateDB Register now That’s where AI Knowledge Assistants come in.

Retrieval Component This component manages the retrieval of information from the knowledge base, where domain-specific data is stored in the format of vector embeddings. For example, when a user asks a question, the system creates an embedding of that query and searches for the most similar content in the vector database. 2. Augmentation Component This component enriches the quality of the prompt by integrating context into the original user query. Essentially, the system augments the user’s question with the relevant information retrieved by the retrieval component, ensuring the Large Language Model (LLM) has direct access to domain-specific knowledge. Phase 3: Response Generation This is the component that generates the final output or answer based on the augmented prompt.

Many companies have attempted to address the problem of inaccessible information in the enterprise, with varying degrees of success. Yet, the solutions remain costly, time-consuming, and challenging to use. Why enterprise search solutions don’t solve the problem Consider your own hard drive, likely filled with a variety of notes, documents, screenshots, scans, and more. Identifying the content of each file often requires opening them individually. Similarly, enterprise data on a larger scale is just as, if not more, disorganized. It's stored across various formats and applications, including Slack messages, support message queues, call transcripts, and more. Up to 80% of enterprise data is unstructured, scattered across different locations and formats. For this data to be included in enterprise search, it must first be located, read by a human or machine, categorized, tagged with keywords, or otherwise processed. This makes setup and maintenance a significant undertaking. The quality of a companyʼs search results is dependent on its metadata tagging system. Inconsistent tag usage or inaccurate keywords can make information hard or even impossible to find.

AI offers significant improvements over traditional keyword searches, including understanding the context and parsing the meaning of questions. This ability allows AI assistants to understand data more deeply, categorizing content with greater accuracy than keyword-based crawlers. For example, if an employee asks about the revenue from the latest marketing campaign, the assistant can gather data from both Salesforce and Google Drive to provide a comprehensive response. This feature eliminates the effort required to implement enterprise search and maintain a company's knowledge management system. There's no need for tagging, creating knowledge cards, or extensive data processing. The use of AI Knowledge Assistants introduces a more intuitive and user-friendly experience through natural language conversations. These assistants can learn from every interaction, improving their ability to predict the user's needs and streamline the search process.

However, the security of such a solution raises concerns. Many enterprises worry about potential data leaks from employee use of ChatGPT. Typically, the simplest way to provide data to an LLM company is to index and store it, but this approach can lead to security vulnerabilities and longer rollout times. An alternative - hosting the enterprise AI solution on the company's own cloud - can increase costs. Dash AI takes a different approach. Instead of indexing data, it connects to applications via APIs, performs real-time searches, ranks the received data, and passes it through an LLM for a natural-language response. This method, which combines advanced API technology with sophisticated LLMs, significantly reduces the risk of a security breach as all data is stored in first-party apps. It also boosts company productivity by providing real-time natural language access to all company data at an affordable price. What's next? With growing burnout rates, and workforce shortages, helping employees seamlessly access internal information is more important than ever. But a traditional enterprise search or knowledge management platform is clearly not the answer. The electrifying rise of generative AI tools offer a new approach that have the potential to make company knowledge as ubiquitous and easy-to-access as a quick Google search.

The greater the amount of information your employees have at their hand, the better equipped they are to work. Maintaining knowledge and keeping it current is difficult because big data sets are constantly changing with every technological development. Thus, it is necessary for an organization's growth and development to have a knowledge management tool. Using knowledge management systems, companies can organize various documents, FAQs, and other information into formats that can be easily accessed internally and externally. With robust knowledge management, employees access all the necessary information as part of a smart and transparent work environment. By providing employees access to the repository of information, the knowledge management system ensures that deep, profound, open communication occurs. It helps organizations to keep documentation up- to-date. An organization's knowledge management process strives to capture, structure, retain, and share its employees' knowledge and experiences. The use of knowledge management systems can be internal to organizations or teams but can also be used to center your knowledge base for the benefit of your employees.

This kind of setup only encourages the siloed structure that most enterprises are trying to lift off. But then, how do you ensure that the least time is devoted to finding information and solutions to problems that happen frequently or have happened in the past? Addressing inefficiencies like this requires a more structured approach to information handling, and this is where Enterprise Knowledge Management (EKM) comes in.

Enterprise Knowledge Management, or enterprise information management (EIM), is the systematic process of capturing, organizing, and leveraging an organization's data using advanced technology to enhance its strategic capabilities. It goes beyond simple information cataloging, focusing on the intelligent curation and deployment of knowledge assets to drive innovation, streamline decision- making, and facilitate cross- functional collaboration. A knowledge management system helps you find information and answers to your questions/ issues. It eliminates the need for a dedicated team to help find answers to already existing solutions. For example, you can quickly find answers to questions about company policies, like the leave policy or accessing the company VPN. https://www.atomicwork.com/esm/enterprise-knowledge-management-guide 3/28 1/22/25, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management [2024] | Atomicwork With tools like Atomicwork, this becomes easier as the AI Assistant, Atom, understands your message and its context to provide the best answer and the source.

How do I access my work files from my home? How has enterprise information management evolved? EIM has evolved significantly over the years, becoming more agile and user-friendly. Initially, organizations heavily relied on human agents or self-service portals that allowed employees access to information. The result was human agents overflowing with support requests they could barely handle. https://www.atomicwork.com/esm/enterprise-knowledge-management-guide 4/28 1/22/25, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management [2024] | Atomicwork Alternatively, self-help portals were difficult to use and remained underutilized in most enterprises. They also lacked proper integration with daily operations and workflows and provided generic responses, limiting the effectiveness of early EIM systems. No wonder all these led to employees resorting to manual processes for information. As technology advanced, we witnessed the rise of collaboration platforms like Slack and MS Teams, which integrated EIM seamlessly into our daily operations. These platforms deliver enterprise information directly within the platform, empowering employees not to switch between multiple tools at the same time.

Managing enterprise knowledge helps organizations and employees to: 1. Faster responses for end- users: With a robust knowledge management system, end-users can self-serve information and don't have to wait for their queries to be answered. This leads to quicker problem resolution and improved user satisfaction. 2. Reduced team workload: Service agents are not bogged down with repetitive queries as requests are deflected from the service desk with a rich knowledge management system. This allows support teams to focus on more complex issues and strategic initiatives. For example, Ammex Corp, a leading safety gloves distributor, experienced significant improvements after implementing an AI-driven knowledge management system. They were able to achieve a query deflection https://www.atomicwork.com/esm/enterprise-knowledge-management-guide 6/28 1/22/25, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management [2024] | Atomicwork rate of 65% with our AI assistant, Atom.

It helps employees be more productive by quickly finding the answer to their queries. Google uses open communication and data-driven decision-making to encourage collaboration and ongoing learning, leading to groundbreaking innovations. 6. Standardize knowledge discovery and handling: When you use a knowledge management system, you set standardized methods and processes for capturing data, storing it, and disseminating it. This helps create a structured format and consistency in knowledge assets, making it easier for employees to consume the information. 7. Helps mitigate loss of information: Without centralized knowledge management, information retrieval depends on individuals. Therefore, there is a risk of losing critical information after an employee leaves. Knowledge management mitigates this risk by creating an automated system that pulls information from various sources, updates it, keeps it safe, and makes it usable. The stages of enterprise knowledge management https://www.atomicwork.com/esm/enterprise-knowledge-management-guide 9/28 1/22/25, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management [2024] | Atomicwork Managing enterprise knowledge is a multi-stage process that requires careful planning and implementation.

Organize different workspaces for every department Different departments in your organization have unique information management needs. For instance: Your HR department may need to maintain and make information on leave policies and nominee processes easily accessible The IT team might want to own a repository of troubleshooting guides for common device issues The Finance department could require a centralized location for expense policies and reimbursement procedures To address these needs, it's crucial to organize your teams and knowledge sources to ensure employees have access to the right information from the right team. This is where the concept of workspaces comes in. With Atomicwork, you can segment and set up dedicated 'workspaces' for each team or department. These workspaces allow you to: Create separate knowledge hubs for HR, IT, finance, and other departments https://www.atomicwork.com/esm/enterprise-knowledge-management-guide 13/28 1/22/25, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management [2024] | Atomicwork Customize each workspace with its own set of knowledge sources and information Ensure that employees can easily find department-specific information without wading through irrelevant data For example, you can set up an HR workspace with all HR-related policies and procedures, an IT workspace with technical guides and troubleshooting information, and a finance"}

This segmentation helps streamline information access and maintains content relevance for each department. 3. Connect your knowledge sources Finding accurate answers requires the AI to be connected with the right knowledge sources and learn from them continuously. It learns from: Conversations in the Slack/Microsoft channels you’ve added The documents you upload, like PDFs, CSV files, etc., and the URLs you provide. Notion pages and SharePoint documents are available if you https://www.atomicwork.com/esm/enterprise-knowledge-management-guide 14/28 1/22/25, 10:23 PM The Ultimate Guide to Enterprise Knowledge Management [2024] | Atomicwork connect your Notion/SharePoint account to Atomicwork. FAQs which can be saved as verified answers (we’ll check this next) To do so, you must connect your workspace to various knowledge sources like SharePoint, Confluence, and Notion. This helps your AI assistant to pull knowledge directly from these platforms and keep them up-to-date. For example, you can link Confluence to the IT workspace if your IT department uses that for documentation. Upload all the documents relevant to each department, such as the employee handbook, PPT, or other documents. Add all the relevant URLs, such as the company’s VPN access guide, so that the database is updated frequently. Atomicwork lets you"}

Here's What We Learned Navigating a multitude of knowledge bases (including our own) led us to create an AI-powered assistant Letʼs start with a bit of honesty: enterprise knowledge bases are a mess more frequently than organizations want to admit. How do we know? Well, letʼs just say, weʼve seen our share of haphazardly scattered pages and documents in which finding an answer would be a quest on its own. And finding an answer immediately would be nearly impossible. https://intellias.com/enterprise-ai-knowledge-management/ 1/11 1/23/25, 12:36 AM AI for Enterprise Knowledge Management: Intellias Experience First, we tried relying on various tools, all serving different purposes across different teams.

We also wanted our new enterprise AI knowledge management system to act like a 24/7 advisor for employees – essentially, a bot guiding them through any type of request, from booking vacations to making career or rotation choices. So, how could AI help? While exploring the vast opportunities of AI, we found its primary strengths: locating relevant information, structuring it, and generating responses based on requests. Sounds like a game- changer? It really is. Did you know that according to a study by the International Data Corporation (IDC), employees spend over five hours a week waiting for information? This leads to delayed projects and annual productivity losses of up to $31.5 billion – just by failing to share knowledge among employees! Itʼs not like companies havenʼt tried to optimize knowledge sharing. According to the same IDC report, businesses have invested over $2.7 billion per year in knowledge management automation since the 1990s. Every year. But have these expensive attempts worked?

In short, it is a centralized repository of information. To elaborate, a knowledge base isnʼt merely a static collection of information but a dynamic resource, with a capacity to grow and evolve as the company develops. A knowledge base is also an integral component of enterprise knowledge management: a system for leveraging and organizing information within the company through creating, retaining, transferring, and applying knowledge. Knowledge creation happens through research, experimentation, and collaboration. Basically, it is the process of generating new ideas, identifying opportunities, exploring new concepts, and"}

Knowledge creation happens through research, experimentation, and collaboration. Basically, it is the process of generating new ideas, identifying opportunities, exploring new concepts, and developing innovative solutions. Knowledge retention is about preserving existing knowledge, ensuring long-term access to critical assets like documents, data, and expertise. This involves systems for documentation, training, and structured processes to effectively capture and store information. Knowledge transfer requires an effective system for sharing expertise between employees and teams through methods such as mentoring, coaching, and structured sessions like communities of practice. Knowledge application is translating knowledge into action to solve problems and make strategic decisions. This involves training, using decision-making frameworks, and sharing best practices across the organization. But a knowledge management system is not enough; you still need a centralized place to consolidate all company knowledge that is accessible to all employees at any time. And that is where AI-powered platforms come into play. https://intellias.com/enterprise-ai-knowledge-management/ 3/11 1/23/25, 12:36 AM AI for Enterprise Knowledge Management: Intellias Experience AI in enterprise knowledge management software Get in touch The rise of generative AI has completely altered the landscape of knowledge management tools.

If you haven't read the previous article yet, be sure to check it out: Building AI Knowledge Assistants for Enterprise PDFs: A Strategic Approach 1. Extracting from PDFs Before you can feed your data into an RAG pipeline, you need to extract it from PDFs. This step sets the foundation for the entire workflow.

However, be mindful of formatting, especially in scanned PDFs with no digital text layer. CrateDB Also consider headers and footers, whichR oefgtiesnte cro nnotwain valuable information like document titles, chapter names, page numbers, or dates. You may opt to remove them from the main body of text and store them separately as part of the document’s metadata. Image Detection Some PDFs include images or diagrams that may hold critical information. Identifying these images is essential if you need a fully comprehensive pipeline that can reference not just text but also visual elements. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) OCR transforms the scanned images of text into machine-readable text, thereby creating a “digital text layer” where none existed before. This ensures you can index, extract, and analyze the content just like any other text-based PDF. The process can be resource- intensive (often requiring GPUs), but it’s indispensable for processing large volumes of scanned documents. Table Extraction When PDFs contain data in tabular format, consider using specialized tools or libraries (e.g., Tabula, Camelot) to extract tables accurately. Tables often include important figures or text organized in rows and columns, which may otherwise be lost if parsed as standard text. Decide whether to keep"}

Table Extraction When PDFs contain data in tabular format, consider using specialized tools or libraries (e.g., Tabula, Camelot) to extract tables accurately. Tables often include important figures or text organized in rows and columns, which may otherwise be lost if parsed as standard text. Decide whether to keep the table structure (e.g., converting to CSV or HTML) or to summarize the data for downstream tasks like embedding or semantic search. Metadata Collection Don’t forget about titles, authors, creation dates, and other metadata. These details help with advanced filtering and can also influence the retrieval steps later. In some cases, you might add header and footer data here if it provides contextual clues or helps distinguish versions of a document. 2.

Structure and Content-Aware Chunking: Considers sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters when chunking. Preserve logical boundaries, which can significantly improve retrieval quality. Document-Based Chunking: With this chunking method, you split a document based on its inherent structure. This approach respects the natural flow of the content but may not be as effective for documents that lack a clear structure. Hierarchical Chunking: Combines fixed-size and structure-awareness by chunking at multiple levels (document → chapter → paragraph) and linking them in a parent-child relationship. Semantic Chunking: The main idea is to group text segments with similar meaning. You create embeddings for each segment, then compare those embeddings to see which ones are most closely related. This approach keeps similar ideas together, preventing arbitrary splits that could harm retrieval quality. Agentic Chunking: This method empowers an LLM to dynamically decide how to split the text into chunks. We begin by extracting short, independent statements from the text and let an LLM agent determine if each statement should join an existing chunk or start a new one. Because the model understands context, it can produce more coherent chunks than fixed or structural methods. 3. Generating Embeddings Once you have your chunks, each chunk needs a vector representation (an embedding) that captures its semantic meaning.

Define clear personas Start by defining clear personas and specific use cases to build something of tangible value. While it’s appealing to explore the capabilities of Q Business and experiment with the art of the possible, the key to ensuring user adoption is to create solutions that people genuinely want to use. For instance, using Q’s plugins to create tickets or incidents is impressive, but it may not deliver the most significant value or address your most pressing pain points. Focus on these critical areas to build trust that your Q solution can be a valuable business asset, then gradually add more functionality. For example, in our organisation, we identified knowledge management as a common challenge. We tailored our initial application to consult our internal file storage system, enabling it to quickly retrieve information and reusable assets. This functionality significantly reduces the time spent searching for files and consulting team members for file locations, streamlining our workflows and enhancing productivity. https://www.devoteam.com/expert-view/7-best-practices-for-creating-enterprise-knowledge-ai-assistant/ 2/7 1/23/25, 12:40 AM 7 Best Practices for Creating Enterprise Knowledge AI Assistant | Devoteam An example Persona we created for our Proof of Concept 2.

These models have opened many use cases, reshaping sectors from customer service to content creation. However, an often-overlooked aspect in this discourse is the practicality of productizing and scaling these use cases to support tens of thousands of users2. The challenges range from expanding server capacity, tweaking algorithms, ensuring robustness and reliability, and maintaining privacy and security. In this article, we describe some of the considerations necessary when developing an enterprise-level knowledge assistant (KA) and introduce a scalable architecture. Foundational Architecture Principles A well-designed KA must offer round-the-clock operation in a demanding enterprise environment and embody more than just cutting-edge AI capabilities. It should be fine-tuned for quality and speed and structured for continuous improvement, allowing for seamless integration and evolution of new functionalities. These operational imperatives set the stage for this proposed architectural design.

These operational imperatives set the stage for this proposed architectural design. To achieve these high standards of operational excellence, the KA is built upon five foundational architecture principles. Each principle plays a critical role in ensuring that the KA meets the immediate needs of a large user base and remains a versatile and forward-looking solution, ready to adapt and grow with the changing landscape of enterprise requirements. Scalability: Addressing the high volume of interactions and the expansion needs of AI applications. Security: Ensuring data safety and strict access control in a world where information security is paramount. Transparency: Offering clear insights into system operations, usage metrics, and cost implications. Modularity: Facilitating easy upgrades and modifications to stay abreast of technological advancements. Reusability: Promoting efficiency and collaboration by designing components that can be used across various projects. These foundational architecture principles are intricately woven into every aspect of the suggested design, forming the backbone of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) architecture. Early-Stage Decisions Enhancing KA’s Foundational Principles Quality Over Cost: We know quality matters. This foundational choice means accepting more significant upfront expenses linked to token usage and infrastructure. This decision is worthwhile as better performance and reliability from these quality investments bring tangible savings. Service-Based LLMs: Another critical early decision adopts a service-based approach to LLMs. This choice underscores the need for flexibility and scalability in a KA’s language-processing capabilities.

By integrating state-of-the-art service-based LLMs, any KA is equipped to rapidly adapt to changing conditions and technological advances, positioning it as a cutting-edge solution in this technology realm. LLM-Agnosticism: As the space of generative AI develops, and new players and models enter the space regularly, it is essential that a KA is future-proofed by offering the option to switch the underlying LLM(s) easily. These early-stage decisions shape the design of a KA into a robust, adaptable, and high-performing enterprise KA. As we explore the multi-layered architecture of such a KA in the following sections, we’ll see how these enhanced principles drive the design and functionality of each layer in the system. A RAG architecture At the core of the KA is a carefully crafted architecture segmented into four essential layers, each with its unique function and set of challenges. This multi-layered approach forms the KA’s structural and operational framework, grounded by the foundational principles described above. Data Layer: The foundation, where vast amounts of data are processed and prepared for retrieval. It is crucial for the KA’s enterprise-specific intelligence. LLM Layer: The general-purpose intelligence and processing center for all language model requests, ensuring contextually accurate and relevant responses.

It is crucial for the KA’s enterprise-specific intelligence. LLM Layer: The general-purpose intelligence and processing center for all language model requests, ensuring contextually accurate and relevant responses. Reporting Layer: The analytical segment, which provides usage, cost, and performance metrics insights. Application Layer: The user-facing interface and backend with business logic – a key layer of the KA that navigates logic for forming responses to end-users. As we embark on a detailed journey through the layers, we will briefly examine the Data, LLM, and Reporting layers, highlighting their roles and significance. The spotlight will then shift to an in-depth look at the Application Layer, where the KA’s functionalities come to life, directly interacting with, and serving, the end-users. 1. Data Layer The Data Layer of the KA is integral to its “enterprise-specific” intelligence, anchored by a vector store that stores documents in chunks, along with their embeddings and metadata4. This vector store is essential for facilitating search using semantic similarity on a large scale, ensuring performance remains robust even as data volumes expand. LLMs have limits on how much data they can accept and process at one time (also known as token limits), making it hard to process long documents simultaneously. We recommend use of a well-known “chunking” technique to break documents into smaller parts to solve this. This enables search across the whole document in steps, avoiding an LLM’s token limit. Metadata stored alongside chunks enables us to associate information found during searches with source documents. Custom pipelines enrich"}

We recommend use of a well-known “chunking” technique to break documents into smaller parts to solve this. This enables search across the whole document in steps, avoiding an LLM’s token limit. Metadata stored alongside chunks enables us to associate information found during searches with source documents. Custom pipelines enrich the data with as much relevant metadata as possible to improve search results. This capability maintains context and relevance in the KA’s responses. Selecting the suitable vector database and the appropriate chunking strategy is critical. Different chunking strategies, such as syntactic versus semantic, variable versus fixed, play distinct roles in how data is processed and retrieved5. To handle the vast amounts of data, we recommend a Data Lake with data processing pipelines, implemented with a framework like the open-source Python-based Kedro6. These pipelines should be tasked with parsing, chunking, metadata enrichment, and vectorizing data chunks, subsequently populating the vector databases. These pipelines need well-structured and indexed data storage, so it is crucial to have healthy data quality and governance in place. Additionally, the Data Layer can provide access to various knowledge APIs, like a People Directory and a Wiki, to further enrich the KA’s responses. These APIs may offer additional context and relevant information, enhancing the capability to deliver tailored and intelligent responses. Finally, it’s important to control who can access what. If a user can’t see a document, the KA should not take it into response formation. The data access control component should be decoupled from the KA itself."}

The data access control component should be decoupled from the KA itself. This approach not only fortifies security and ensures compliance but also elegantly paves the way for seamless scalability across multiple KAs. 2. LLM Layer The LLM Layer in the KA’s architecture serves as the central unit of processing. This layer is uniquely designed to handle the complexities and demands of processing language model requests, playing a critical role in the functionality of the KA. A key component of the LLM Layer is the LLM API Gateway. This gateway is the conduit through which all requests pass, acting as a centralized processing point. Its design includes scalable-on-demand integrations with multiple LLM vendors, offering the flexibility to easily switch services as needed. This versatility is crucial in maintaining operational efficiency and adapting to various requirements or changes in vendor capabilities. An important function of the LLM API Gateway is its ability to track the costs associated with using LLMs (e.g. tokens generated, subscriptions). This feature is vital for managing the operational budget and optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, the gateway logs all interactions in a logging platform. This logging is not just about keeping a record; it’s a treasure trove of data that can be analyzed for improvements, troubleshooting, and understanding usage patterns."}

This feature is vital for managing the operational budget and optimizing resource allocation. Additionally, the gateway logs all interactions in a logging platform. This logging is not just about keeping a record; it’s a treasure trove of data that can be analyzed for improvements, troubleshooting, and understanding usage patterns. Within this layer, there is direct access to both LLM models and Embedding models. The LLM models are the backbone of the KA’s language understanding and generation capabilities. Meanwhile, the Embeddings models, which are also used by the Data Layer for vectorizing document chunks, play a critical role in enhancing the semantic search capabilities of the KA. 3. Reporting Layer The Reporting Layer in any KA’s architecture is essential for providing transparency on several critical fronts: costs, usage, and data analytics. This layer is intricately designed to capture and present a comprehensive view of the KA’s operational dynamics, making it an invaluable tool for both management and continuous improvement. One of the primary functions of the Reporting Layer is cost analysis to track and analyze all expenses related to the operations of the KA. This includes costs associated with token consumption by LLMs, data processing, and other computational resources. By offering detailed insights into these expenditures, the Reporting Layer enables effective budget management and helps identify opportunities for cost optimization. Another crucial aspect of this layer is usage monitoring. It keeps a close watch on how the KA is being used across the organization. This monitoring covers various metrics, such"}

Another crucial aspect of this layer is usage monitoring. It keeps a close watch on how the KA is being used across the organization. This monitoring covers various metrics, such as the number of user interactions, peak usage times, and the types of queries being processed. Understanding these usage patterns is vital for scaling the KA effectively and ensuring it meets the evolving needs of the enterprise. Additionally, the Reporting Layer delves into data analytics, providing an in-depth look at the performance and effectiveness of the KA. This includes analyzing response accuracy, user satisfaction, and the overall efficiency of the KA’s operations. Such analytics are instrumental in guiding future improvements, ensuring the KA remains a cutting-edge tool for the enterprise. 4. Application Layer The Application Layer is where the functionality of the KA comes to the forefront, directly engaging with users. This layer is where user queries are generated, received, processed, and responded to, encompassing the end-to-end interaction that defines the user experience. The Application Layer comprises of four main components: Frontend: This is the user interface of the KA, where users interact and input their queries. Operational Stores: These are databases that store the KA’s conversational history and user feedback. Configuration Stores: This component contains glossaries for query improvement and prompts from response generation. Backend: The backend processes API requests from frontend, handling the intricate task of understanding and"}

Configuration Stores: This component contains glossaries for query improvement and prompts from response generation. Backend: The backend processes API requests from frontend, handling the intricate task of understanding and generating responses integrating to services from LLMs and Data Layers Frontend The frontend of the KA should be a straightforward web interface, typically crafted using React and JavaScript. Design should consider ease of use, for users to simply ask questions, receive answers, and access guidelines for effective interaction with the KA. This interface design may consider inclusion of a feature for users to provide feedback, essential for refining the KA’s performance. Responses to user queries should be supported by clearly cited sources to offer a reliable reference for the shared information. Additionally, answers may include links to relevant enterprise micro-sites or suggest contacts within the organization who can offer further assistance on the topic. This approach adds a layer of practical utility to each response, directing users to additional resources or personnel that can provide more in-depth support or information. The modular design of the KA architecture plays a key role here. It allows for the possibility of substituting a frontend with alternative interfaces in the future, such as a mobile app or an instant messaging platform. This flexibility comes about because the backend interactions occur through APIs, enabling seamless integration with various frontends while maintaining consistent functionality and user"}

It allows for the possibility of substituting a frontend with alternative interfaces in the future, such as a mobile app or an instant messaging platform. This flexibility comes about because the backend interactions occur through APIs, enabling seamless integration with various frontends while maintaining consistent functionality and user experience. Operational Stores Operational stores form the backend persistence layer, responsible for the storage of conversation history, user settings, feedback, and other critical operational data essential for the KA to be functional. Conversation history is particularly important for providing historic context to the LLM, enhancing the relevance of responses in ongoing interactions. Additionally, the information gathered in operational stores is crucial for the continuous improvement of the KA. This data is analyzed within the Data Layer to identify trends and areas for enhancement, directly influencing the KA’s development and refinement. Insights derived from this analysis are then presented in the Reporting Layer, providing a comprehensive view of the KA’s interactions and effectiveness, which is vital for its ongoing optimization and success. Backend The backend is where the core business logic of the KA resides. It’s structured as a set of components, each with a single responsibility, working together to process user interactions efficiently. At a high-level, it is an orchestration of different decisions and LLM operations.

At a high-level, it is an orchestration of different decisions and LLM operations. It handles critical functions such as accessing the Data Layer and LLMs, analyzing incoming requests, formulating messages, and delivering responses. Each component is designed to perform its specific task effectively, ensuring that the entire process from query intake to response delivery is smooth and precise. The following section traces a user query through the complete backend architecture. Input Handler Request Handler The Application Layer of the KA activates upon receiving a user query through an API. The Request Handler manages chat interactions and retrieves the last few messages in a conversation from the Conversation History Store. Additionally, the Request Handler loads the current configurations for the LLMs used in the application. Input Guardrails Once the necessary database operations are completed, the Input Guardrails apply. In any specific context, input guardrails encompass a selection of policies, business rules, and validations, and are designed to ensure that incoming requests meet predefined criteria and may proceed. The primary objective of these guardrails is to prevent users from using the system in ways that deviate from its intended purpose. For instance, in the scenario of a flight booking app, customers should not have the capability to inquire about other passengers beyond the scope of their valid booking. Guardrails are essentially a stack of functions arranged in a predetermined order. Each function evaluates the incoming request input and its metadata and takes one of three possible actions. The possible"}

Guardrails are essentially a stack of functions arranged in a predetermined order. Each function evaluates the incoming request input and its metadata and takes one of three possible actions. The possible actions include “pass” indicating that the guardrail approves the request without any issues; “update” this suggests the request requires modification before being allowed to pass; and “reject” signaling that the request failed the guardrail and cannot continue for processing, this terminates the process and returns a rejection reason to the requester. This approach ensures that requests that fail the guardrails are rejected early and if requests require modifications before being shared further then this is handled appropriately, this not only ensures adherences to intended use cases but also efficiently processes incoming requests for maximum reliability. One such update-guardrail is the Query Improver. This component is crucial for adapting domain-specific terminology to enhance later retrieval processes. In many industries and business, queries include niche jargon, abbreviations, and phrases unique to the industry. These can be obscure or have different meanings in general language. To address this, the implementation should include a comprehensive glossary of company-specific terms and abbreviations. This glossary “translates” and modifies user queries for optimal retrieval. For instance, it could remove trailing punctuation and expand acronyms in the queries (e.g. “MVP” is reformulated as “MVP (Minimum Viable Product)”). Such alterations significantly boost the retrieval effectiveness on proprietary data. Eliminating"}

For instance, it could remove trailing punctuation and expand acronyms in the queries (e.g. “MVP” is reformulated as “MVP (Minimum Viable Product)”). Such alterations significantly boost the retrieval effectiveness on proprietary data. Eliminating punctuation aids in aligning the query’s semantic similarity with a corpus, which predominantly consists of statements rather than questions. Expanding abbreviations is doubly beneficial: it increases the prominence of key terms in the retrieval process, ensures coverage of content that may only use the expanded form, and aids the chat model in accurately interpreting the user’s intent. Such refinements are instrumental in enhancing the overall performance and accuracy of a KA. The next step in the process is the Intent Recognition module, a common feature in LLM applications designed to bring structure to the typically unstructured nature of LLMs. This module’s function is to categorize each user query into one of several pre-defined intents. The identified intent plays a dual role: it guides the subsequent control flow within the application and enhances the effectiveness of the knowledge retrieval system. The most reliable method for intent recognition isn’t a highly specialized machine learning model but rather an LLM. To improve the LLM’s accuracy, we suggest a few-shot prompting technique with balanced examples for each intent. For instance, if we have five intents and three examples per intent to ensure accurate classification, then every intent is represented with three examples. This gives"}

For instance, if we have five intents and three examples per intent to ensure accurate classification, then every intent is represented with three examples. This gives us a total of 15 examples in the prompt. This method is highly effective for setups with fewer than ten intents, achieving over 90% accuracy. However, it’s important to note that this approach has its limitations. As the number of intents increases, adding more examples becomes less practical, and distinguishing between intents becomes more challenging. Response Formation Data Source Routing The Data Source Routing module determines where the KA receives its knowledge based on the user’s intent. With the user’s intent, the KA picks between three primary data sources, each accessible through a custom search algorithm or external APIs: Vector Store: Text documents, like PDFs, PowerPoints, and Word documents. All chunks have metadata that enables filtering like title, abstract, authors etc. People Directory API: Personnel information, specific skills, and contact details. Internal Wiki API: Company-related information, IT instructions, HR documents and more. The real advantage of intent recognition lies in its flexibility to incorporate additional data sources as needed. Beyond enhancing the control over the KA’s outputs, selective querying of data sources offers another significant benefit. While many solutions emphasize vector stores and semantic similarity search, not all data types are equally suited for such methods. For example, a people"}

Beyond enhancing the control over the KA’s outputs, selective querying of data sources offers another significant benefit. While many solutions emphasize vector stores and semantic similarity search, not all data types are equally suited for such methods. For example, a people directory, with its distinct data, doesn’t fit as seamlessly into an embedding database as long documents do. In a standard similarity search, even well-detailed people profiles might not rank high enough to be included in the top results. Intent recognition circumvents this issue through clearly defined control flow. This behavior can be implemented using different chains for different intents, as in the example below. INTENT_CHAIN_MAPPING = { IntentType.KNOWLEDGE: KnowledgeChain, IntentType.PEOPLE: PeopleChain, IntentType.SUPPORT: WikiChain, IntentType.CHAT: ChatChain, IntentType.DOMAIN_KNOWLEDGE: DomainKnowledgeChain, } def get_response(question: str, conversation_history: List[Message]): chain = intent_chain_mapping[intent] llm = AIGateway(model=’gpt-4’) llm_task = asyncio.create_task(chain.acall(question, llm, conversation_history)) # ... response = await llm_task return response ### ---------------- ### class KnowledgeChain(Chain): # ... class DomainKnowledgeChain(Chain): # ... class ChatChain(Chain): # ... class PeopleChain(Chain): # ... Retriever The question is then passed to the Retriever. Depending on the targeted search the retriever will either embed the question through LLM Gateway and perform a semantic similarity search, use it for a keyword search, or pass it to an external API that handles the retrieval. The Retriever should be tailored to manage different types of data effectively. Each data source not only varies in content but also in the optimal amount of information to retrieve. For example,"}

The Retriever should be tailored to manage different types of data effectively. Each data source not only varies in content but also in the optimal amount of information to retrieve. For example, the breadth and depth of data needed from a people directory differs significantly from the same required from a knowledge base. To address this, the retrieval logic needs customization. For people-related queries, the retriever is configured to return a concise list of the top five most relevant contacts from the directory. In contrast, a search for knowledge yields a broader set, pulling up to 20 chunks of information to provide a more comprehensive context. This approach, however, is not rigid. For specific intents where a more integrated perspective is beneficial, a Retriever should combine data from multiple sources. For instance, a user seeking guidance in a specific domain will receive information both from the vector store and the wiki as a mix is likely to be most useful to the user. Fine-tuning the process means definition of a search algorithm that can combine different semantic similarity search algorithms, exact keyword matching and metadata filtering.

Continuous feedback loops with early-access users are crucial in the optimization process, to iteratively refine the retrieval strategies until the balance of quantity, quality, and source diversity is just right. Context Enrichment A KA’s context enrichment phase requires crafting effective prompts. These prompts must harmoniously blend instructions from the assistant, retrieved context, and the chat history. This process is heavily influenced by the detected intent and come with varying levels of difficulty in consolidating data from different sources. A significant challenge may typically arise in ensuring the relevance and conceptual cohesion for queries seeking pure knowledge. To mitigate reliance on semantic search and enhance accuracy of the final chat completion, there should be consideration given to the strategy inspired by the MapReduceChain in LangChain7 (see KnowledgeChain example below). This method involves deploying parallel LLM calls for each information chunk, instructing the model to not just evaluate but also synthesize information across these chunks. This approach is pivotal in ensuring that source citations are accurate. Instead of depending on the LLM to reproduce source links – a method prone to inaccuracies – you should embed source referencing directly into code logic. Furthermore, you should integrate recent conversation history into this enrichment process, enhancing the KA’s ability to provide contextually relevant responses. One strategy uses a common buffer window approach, focusing on the last 3-5 exchanges. The approach not only"}

As a reminder, the LLM prompt needs to include data from the databases (see Data Source Routing and Retriever) and conversation history. Additionally, it’s necessary to give clear instructions to the LLM and format the input data correctly, to determine its behavior, tone, and adherence to the given data. Precise prompt engineering becomes a real challenge, as the outputs need to be accurate and reliable for critical decision-making.

Their insights will be invaluable in refining the KA’s instructions and guiding the selection of source documents. Output Handler Output Guardrails After receiving the final chat completion from the LLM, the next step post processes it in the Output Handler. It is typical to find that no matter how carefully you engineer a prompt and steps in advance of the model, there always remains a final risk of hallucinations, and undesirable information being shown to users8. To mitigate this risk, there should be a set of Output Guardrails in place. These are a set of asynchronously executed checks on the model’s response that include a content filter and a hallucination detector. The content filter detects and removes biased and harmful language as well as removing any personal identifiable information (PII). The hallucination detector checks whether there is any information in the response that is not given in the retrieved context. Both guardrails are based on LLMs. Besides mitigating risk, they also inform future development and troubleshooting efforts.

Summary of Considerations We summarize some of the considerations covered earlier in this article. Chunking: The selection of a chunking strategy significantly impacts the performance of semantic similarity search, the use of context, and the understanding of specific knowledge topics by the language model. Guardrails: Implementing guardrails for input/output is crucial to mitigate risks and ensure the reputation of AI applications in enterprise settings. These guardrails can be customized and developed according to the organization’s risk requirements. Configuration Database: Maintaining a database table to track LLM configurations allows for efficient monitoring, potential rollback capabilities, and the association of specific model versions with user feedback and errors. Search: Fine-tuning the search algorithm involves combining semantic similarity search algorithms, exact keyword matching, and metadata filtering, while continuously optimizing retrieval strategies based on user feedback to achieve the right balance of quantity, quality, and source diversity. Prompt Engineering: Effective prompting is key to the success of an application and can be collaboratively done with users and/or experts.

Controlling LLMs: Introducing intent recognition or a similar deterministic split enhances control flow and provides developers with more control over the behavior of LLM applications. Making Data LLM-ready: Cleaning unstructured data from artifacts (e.g., footers in the middle of chunks) and adding relevant metadata (e.g., titles) to chunks allows LLMs to effectively understand different data types. Separating Data Sources: While it may be tempting to mix all types of data in a vector store and use semantic similarity search, different data types have different requirements, and querying them separately yields much better results. Domain Knowledge: Incorporating specific knowledge through glossaries, prompt engineering, or fine-tuning is essential for LLMs to understand industry or company-specific knowledge. Conclusion In the realm of corporate technology, the integration and application of LLMs offer intriguing insights into the evolving landscape of data management, system architecture, and organizational transformation. This article aims to shed light on these aspects, with an emphasis on the broader application of LLMs within corporate settings. Our discussion is just the beginning of a deeper exploration into the various layers, including data handling, LLM optimization, and impact assessment, essential for deploying advanced LLM applications.

If you haven't read the previous article yet, be sure to check it out: Building AI Knowledge Assistants for Enterprise PDFs: A Strategic Approach 1. Extracting from PDFs Before you can feed your data into an RAG pipeline, you need to extract it from PDFs. This step sets the foundation for the entire workflow.

The goal of your chatbot—whether it needs to present actual images, provide text-only responses, or generate image descriptions—directly impacts how you extract and process each PDF. For instance, if your chatbot must display or summarize images, you’ll need dedicated mechanisms to handle, store, and retrieve them; if you’re only interested in text, you can focus on raw text extraction and OCR. Text Extraction Use libraries or services that identify text within PDFs. For straightforward text, standard PDF parsing libraries work. However, be mindful of formatting, especially in scanned PDFs with no digital text layer. Also consider headers and footers, which often contain valuable information like document titles, chapter names, page numbers, or dates. You may opt to remove them from the main body of text and store them separately as part of the document’s metadata. Image Detection Some PDFs include images or diagrams that may hold critical information. Identifying these images is essential if you need a fully comprehensive pipeline that can reference not just text but also visual elements. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) OCR transforms the scanned images of text into machine-readable text, thereby creating a “digital text layer” where none existed before. This ensures you can index, extract, and analyze the content just like any other text-based PDF. The process can be resource-intensive (often requiring GPUs), but it’s indispensable for processing large volumes of scanned documents. Table Extraction When PDFs contain data in tabular format, consider using specialized tools or libraries (e.g.,"}

The process can be resource-intensive (often requiring GPUs), but it’s indispensable for processing large volumes of scanned documents. Table Extraction When PDFs contain data in tabular format, consider using specialized tools or libraries (e.g., Tabula, Camelot) to extract tables accurately. Tables often include important figures or text organized in rows and columns, which may otherwise be lost if parsed as standard text. Decide whether to keep the table structure (e.g., converting to CSV or HTML) or to summarize the data for downstream tasks like embedding or semantic search. Metadata Collection Don’t forget about titles, authors, creation dates, and other metadata. These details help with advanced filtering and can also influence the retrieval steps later. In some cases, you might add header and footer data here if it provides contextual clues or helps distinguish versions of a document. 2. Chunking Extracted Data Unlike plain search indexes, RAG pipelines often split documents into chunks—manageable text segments used to create embeddings. The reason is simple: LLMs work better when prompts are concise, context-rich, and specific. Fixed-Size Chunking (with overlap): Straightforward approach where each chunk is a fixed number of tokens or characters, and adjacent chunks overlap slightly to retain context. Structure and Content-Aware Chunking: Considers sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters when chunking. Preserve logical boundaries, which can significantly improve retrieval quality. Document-Based Chunking: With this chunking method, you split a document based on its inherent structure. This"}

Structure and Content-Aware Chunking: Considers sentences, paragraphs, sections, or chapters when chunking. Preserve logical boundaries, which can significantly improve retrieval quality. Document-Based Chunking: With this chunking method, you split a document based on its inherent structure. This approach respects the natural flow of the content but may not be as effective for documents that lack a clear structure. Hierarchical Chunking: Combines fixed-size and structure-awareness by chunking at multiple levels (document → chapter → paragraph) and linking them in a parent-child relationship. Semantic Chunking: The main idea is to group text segments with similar meaning. You create embeddings for each segment, then compare those embeddings to see which ones are most closely related. This approach keeps similar ideas together, preventing arbitrary splits that could harm retrieval quality. Agentic Chunking: This method empowers an LLM to dynamically decide how to split the text into chunks. We begin by extracting short, independent statements from the text and let an LLM agent determine if each statement should join an existing chunk or start a new one. Because the model understands context, it can produce more coherent chunks than fixed or structural methods. 3. Generating Embeddings Once you have your chunks, each chunk needs a vector representation (an embedding) that captures its semantic meaning. Choosing Embedding Models Security Considerations: The classification of your documents might prohibit the use of online LLMs, pushing you toward an on-premise or self-hosted model. If confidentiality is"}

Generating Embeddings Once you have your chunks, each chunk needs a vector representation (an embedding) that captures its semantic meaning. Choosing Embedding Models Security Considerations: The classification of your documents might prohibit the use of online LLMs, pushing you toward an on-premise or self-hosted model. If confidentiality is a priority, local deployment can ensure that no data leaves your environment. Data Types (Text, Tables, Images, Multimodal): Text: A text-based embedding model may be sufficient if you only have textual data. Tables: For tabular data, you may need to transform the table into a more descriptive text format or use a specialized approach to preserve row/column relationships. One strategy is to summarize tables first and then generate embeddings from those summaries. Images: If your chatbot must search for images via text or by providing another image (“show me images similar to this”), you’ll need to generate embeddings for the images If you only need to display the original images without advanced search features, you may opt to store them directly in your database. Multimodal models (e.g., CLIP or GPT-4 Vision) can handle both text and images, enabling semantic search across different data types. Task Orientation: Think about the end goal—text-to-text, image-to-text, image-to-image, or table-based queries. Different scenarios benefit from specialized embedding models.

Image & Table Processing: Generating embeddings for images or large tables typically requires more compute resources and sometimes specialized libraries or frameworks. 4. Storing the Data The diversity of data and the sophistication of AI models demand a flexible, powerful, and nuanced approach to data management. As AI continues to penetrate various sectors, the need for databases that can adapt to complex data landscapes becomes paramount. The future of multi-model databases in AI shines—as an enabler of complex, context-rich, and real-time intelligent applications. In a RAG workflow, you need to store: Raw Text (and possibly images or OCR’d text) Embeddings (vectors) Metadata (title, author, date, source) A robust multi-model database that can handle real-time ingestion of large datasets, manage high concurrency, and scale horizontally is a key piece of infrastructure.
